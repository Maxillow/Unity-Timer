# Unity-Timer
I just needed a custom timer that changed between 1 minute and 5 second intervals and couldn't find a good one so I made one myself in Unity. There are probably several much easier ways to do this. Oh well.

At least whoever else who needs this speciifc type of timer can use this as a base instead of starting from scratch.
